            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALthough I am no Conjurer, yet I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I have done enough to raiſe the ſpirits of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which are wont to be very troubleſome, and that it may exceed my skill to allay them: And therefore I have thus ſeaſonably (I hope) taken Sanctuary under Your Name; for I have obſerved that ſome conſecrated Perſons, as well as Places, are not haunted with ſuch Spectres. And though ſuch Apparitions have been very affrighting &amp; vexatious to Men of weak judgments &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering minds, yet ſome Perſons who have arm'd themſelves with conſtant integrity to God, and reſolved Loyalty to the King, have been leaſt obnoxious to their power and malice; as good
<pb facs="tcp:101058:3"/>Souldiers that keep their ranks are not ſo much expoſed to the hazards of War, as they whoſe fears make them ſneak from Place to Place. And this, through God's good providence, was Your ſecurity in the late Times of Confuſion, wherein notwithſtanding the buſie Emiſſaries of the Prince of Darkneſs, you did not only ſhine as a bright Example of Chriſtian reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſound Doctrine, and a holy Life, but did really influence a great part of your neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clergy, the ſenſe whereof hath obliged me to this publick acknowledgment; by which I cannot hope to add to your reputation, but to provide for my own quiet, againſt ſuch unjuſt and unſavory reflections, as guilty perſons are prone to make, from whom I appeal to your more righteous judgment, whether I have done them wrong, or no. Sure I am I intended them none, for I only preſent them with a Glaſs, wherein if they ſee their own defects, they have no reaſon to be diſpleaſed with the Glaſs, but with thoſe Vices which cauſe the reflexion. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15. of the Tripartite Hiſtory, tells us, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to ſhame the <hi>Arians,</hi> provided by an Edict, that they ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Porphyrians, Ut quorum mores imitati ſunt, eorum nomine perfruantur,</hi> that they might be known by his Name, whoſe manners they did imitate: And a greater than <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did the
<pb facs="tcp:101058:3"/>like by the <hi>Jews, John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, and his luſts ye will do.</hi> Every Man's publick profeſſion and practices are the plaineſt characters to teach us what party he is of. They who through pride and diſcontent raiſe and propagate new Opinions, that they may head a Faction, and take pet at the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of better Men, vexing their Governors, deſpiſing their Authority, perſecuting their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Brethren, and fomenting Diviſions in a well eſtabliſhed Church, are as manifeſtly act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and animated by the ſpirit of <hi>Donatus,</hi> as if there were a tranſmigration of Souls —
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Sic oculos, ſic ille manus, ſic ora gerebat.</hi>

                  <lg>
                     <l>As old <hi>Donatus</hi> did, ſo do his Race,</l>
                     <l>Caſt up their Eyes and Hands with down-caſt Face.</l>

            </p>
            <p>In vain therefore do ſuch pretend, (as with great confidence they do) that they are the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under the Heathen Emperors, for they in the worſt times obeyed their lawful Governors in all things wherein they might not diſobey God, and conſtantly adhered to their Bibles, their Biſhops, and their Brethren, accounting all ſuch <hi>Traditores, (i.e.)</hi> Trayt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, as forſook either. Such pretences therefore do make odious repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the Primitive Chriſtians, as if they were in their Generation as factious and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb facs="tcp:101058:4"/>as the late <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in ours; And as ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions do they caſt on their Chriſtian Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, as if they were very Perſecutors. But, by their fruits ye ſhall know them: for, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how exactly every Scene of that horrid Tragedy, which was firſt acted in the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> hath been acted over, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) over-acted in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it cannot be denyed, that they who deſtroyed the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and its Defender, were the moſt natural off-ſpring of thoſe <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who ſo perpetually vexed the good <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and made Havock of the Churches of <hi>Africa;</hi> or that the preſent Sectaries, who ſo tenaciouſly adhere to the principles, and follow the practices of them that brought ſuch confuſion on the Land in the former Age, are their proper Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>However, it is adviſedly done by their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists, to make their Pamphlets ſwell with the frequent mention of the Indulgence of ſome of the Emperors to peaceable Chriſtians, but paſs by the many ſtrict Edicts of the moſt Chriſtian and pious Emperors, againſt ſuch as withdrew from the Communion of the Catholick Church, ſome of which I have tranſcribed for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information at the end of this Hiſtory, and ſhall only acquaint them here with that ſucceſs which <hi>Sozomen, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11. of the Tripartite Hiſtory, obſerved to follow on the due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:101058:4"/>of them. Who ſpeaking of the Laws of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> againſt ſuch as denyed communion with the Church in his days, The Emperor (ſaith my Author) ſtrictly commanded that their Meeting-places ſhould be taken from them, and they not permitted to aſſemble in private Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or Churches; by reaſon of which Law (I ſuppoſe, ſaith <hi>Sozomen</hi>) the Memorial of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was utterly deſtroy'd, for after this Law, they could meet neither publickly in the Churches, nor ſecretly, being obſerved, and forbidden by the Biſhops and Clergy. Doubtleſs thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergymen were no Perſecutors, they did what was their duty, and by a ſeaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Men of corrupt principles, preſerved the true Chriſtians in peace. And certainly the preſent Biſhops would be defective in a ſpecial duty of their Function, which is to preſerve the Flock of Chriſt in Peace and Unity, if they ſhould tolerate ſuch, as ſeek to ſcatter and make a Prey of them. <hi>St. Hierome,</hi> who is thought by ſome to have been no Friend to that Office, doth yet affirm, that it was ever ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days the beſt Remedy againſt Schiſme. I ſhall entreat your patience, while I mention a paſſage or two of that Father, which have been tortured to ſpeak againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> but do ſo far commend its uſefulneſs, and aſſert its anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and authority, as may ſuffice to ſilence all
<pb facs="tcp:101058:5"/>its adverſaries. In his Comment on 1 <hi>Titus</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Antequam Diaboli inſtinctu, &amp;c.</hi> Before ſuch time, as by the inſtigation of the Devil, Factions were made in Religion, and the People began to ſay, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas,</hi> the Churches were governed by the common Council of <hi>Presbyters:</hi> but afterward, when every one accounted thoſe, whom he had baptized, to be his own, and not Chriſts; it was decreed in the whole (Chriſtian) World, that one, choſen out of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſhould be ſet over the reſt, unto whom the care of the Church ſhould belong, that the ſeeds of ſchiſme might be taken away. Would you know when this was done, and by whom, <hi>Panormitan</hi> will tell you, <hi>Li. Decret. de conſuetud. c.</hi> 4. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after Chriſt's death, all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> ruled in common—but after a while the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould be created for the <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Schiſmes.</hi> If any ſhall not agree that this is St. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s ſenſe, let him compare that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> (85) <hi>Quod autem poſteà,</hi> That after this, (<hi>i.</hi>) in the Apoſtles age, (as appears both by what goes before, and by what follows concerning St. <hi>Mark</hi>) one was choſen and ſet over the reſt, was done for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Schiſme, leſt every one drawing a part of the Church to himſelf, ſhould deſtroy the whole: for in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101058:5"/>from the days of St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt, unto <hi>Heraclas,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> Biſhops there, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> chooſing one of their number, and ſetting him in a Higher degree, called him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: and in his Dialogue, <hi>ad Luciferianos, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae ſalus in ſummi ſacerdotis dignitate pendet, cui ſi non exors, &amp; ab omnibus eminens detur pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas, tot in Eccleſiis efficientur ſchiſmata, quot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes.</hi> So then St. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s teſtimony is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for the Antiquity of Biſhops, (for as to the original inſtitution, I ſhall not now diſcourſe) that they were in the Apoſtles days, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s days, and in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ever ſince the People began to ſay, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Apollo,</hi> for the ending of which controverſie, one was preferred above the reſt; and the Scholiaſt tells us, on <hi>Titus</hi> 1. that <hi>Apollo</hi> was the Man, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Corinth:</hi> and the ſame was decreed in all the Chriſtian World; That the care of the Church was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and the welfare of the Church depended on their dignity, to whom if there were not an eminent and peerleſs power given by all, there would be as many ſchiſmes in the Church, as there were Prieſts; and laſtly, that it was a principal duty of theirs, (though it be now accounted their crime) to prevent the growth of ſchiſms in their ſeveral Churches.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:101058:6"/>
            <p>And this is that which I have (according to my mean capacity) endeavour'd in theſe Papers, wherein I have only applyed that gentle Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which hath been approved by Ancient and Modern Divines, who agree, that, The means to confute ſchiſme, is to reduce it to its firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: for howſoever it comes to paſs, that facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons are in love with their own, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but abhor the actions of their Progenitors.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> If I have ſaid any thing unworthy of your Name, I know, that as your judgment will diſcern it, ſo your candor will pardon it, ſince nothing hath moved me to this attempt, but my duty to the Church, and my particular eſteem of your great Merits, who are a chief Ornament of the ſame; for though you have been placed in an eminent ſtation, yet that you have rather honour'd that dignity, than been dignified by it, is the judgment of all that know you, and not only the private opinion of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT hath been ſometime known, that when divers learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phyſicians, after all their regular methods of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, have given over their Patients as desperate, a mean Empirick, by an eaſie and gentle application, hath effected the Cure. And (having often conſidered with my ſelf, how fruitleſs and ineffectual the many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſcourſes, and unanſwerable Arguments of ſuch as have oppoſed the Separation from our Church, have been; and that the contumacious humor still spreads it ſelf, to the infection and ruine of many precious Souls) I thought it might be expedient to apply another remedy, <hi>(viz.)</hi> A true repreſentation of the Opinions and practices of ſuch Schiſmaticks, as have been condemned in the Primitive times of the Church: whereby, as in a Glaſs, ſuch as are guilty of the preſent Separation, may reflect on their own deformities, and the evil conſequence of their dividing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. Some Women, who have been too well conceited of their beauty, when they have unawares beheld in a clear Glaſs, the deforming and deſtructive effects of a loathſome Diſeaſe, have been ſo ſurpriſed with the change, that is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly made on their Faces, that they have immediately fallen ſick and dyed. And who knows, but when thoſe fanciful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are ſo highly conceited of their purity, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Conſciences, ſhall be convinced, (as by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:101058:7"/>reflection on this Hiſtory of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> they may be) what unclean spots, and viſible defects the Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of ſuch as live in Separation from a well eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Church, have contracted, they may immediately grow ſick of their Sins, and apply themſelves to the mortification of them, that their Souls may be ſaved? It is the Opinion of ſome learned Men, that the Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> hath raiſed more Prejudices againſt the Reformed Churches, by his Annals, than Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And indeed, upon ſuppoſition, that the Relation which he gives of the Primitive Doctrine and Diſcipline is true, (the contrary whereof hath been ſufficiently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and many others) he hath done more to prove our Churches guilty, both of Hereſie and Schiſm, than all the Polemical Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Accordingly, when it ſhall appear by the Authentique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church of God, that thoſe Perſons, who held the ſame Opinions, and followed the ſame practices, as ſome in this preſent Age do, were frequently condemned by the best Chriſtian Emperors, and Catholick Councils, as ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and dangerous, and upon what ſmall and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grounds they have run themſelves into ſuch great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, as have overturned all things Sacred, and well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Church and State; it may be rationally hoped, that, though the moſt cogent arguments have not perſwaded them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et ſuch horrible Spectres may affright them from their ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and unchriſtian apartment, and make them chooſe to live rather with peaceable and humble Chriſtians, in a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Primitive and preſent Church, than among ſuch turbulent spirits, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Opinions and practices of the most dangerous and condemned Schiſmaticks. And it is both a more civil, and facile way of inſinuating inſtructions and reproofs to the
<pb facs="tcp:101058:7"/>minds and conſciences of ſuch, as are averſe from plain dealing, to teach them by pertinent inſtances and examples, by Hiſtorical alluſions, and wiſe Apologues; ſuch as the Parable of Trees uſed by <hi>Jotham,</hi> and of the Ewe-Lamb, by the Prophet <hi>Nathan:</hi> and this method was familiarly uſed by our Saviour, eſpecially when he would convince the Phariſees; as he doth in the Parable of the unthankful Husband-men, <hi>Luke 21.33.</hi> and divers others, wherein he proves them to be worſe than thoſe, who perſecuted the Prophets, by their malice againſt the Son of God, and <hi>v. 45.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>They perceived that he ſpake of them.</hi> In the days of the late <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, The Hiſtory of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> the unfortunate Politician, of <hi>Maſſonello,</hi> and the <hi>Munſter</hi> Anabaptiſts, had their good effect. Moſt Men are ſevere cenſurers of the ſame ſins in others, which they do indulge and allow in themſelves. There is ſcarce a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratist among us, who, when he ſhall impartially conſider the grievous and continued troubles of the <hi>African</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, occaſioned by the Schiſme of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who upon falſe or frivolous pretences, first forſook the Communion of the Catholick Church, and then raiſed Parties to oppoſe it, falſly accuſing, condemning, perſecuting and murthering their Fathers and Brethren, affronting the Magiſtrates, deſpiſing their Laws, raiſing Tumults and Armies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them Martyrs that dyed in Rebellion; I ſay, there is not any, but will readily condemn theſe, though he have been ſeduced to joyn with ſuch, as have practiſed the ſame, or worſe things. The Ancients reſembled a wiſe Man to the Image of <hi>Janus,</hi> which looked both forward and backward; and it would certainly be a point of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in us, to look back, upon the tranſactions and counſels of former Ages, and to obſerve what Opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been condemned by wiſe and good Men, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="tcp:101058:8"/>avoid ſuch. As alſo to look forward, and to conſider, to what dangers and precipices our preſent Opinions may betray us, what out-rages and cruelties our ambition may lead us to, though for the preſent we think it impoſſible, that ever our luſts, or any temptations, or advantages, ſhould be able to tranſform us into ſuch ravenous beasts, as afterward we may appear to be. Had <hi>Cromwel</hi> been foretold, as <hi>Hazael</hi> was, what horrid Maſſacres and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide he ſhould commit, he would have thought it a ſlander, though from the mouth of a Prophet, <hi>2 Kings 8.12.</hi> And if ſuch as have given themſelves up to dividing principles, did but conſider, how eaſily they may be taught to act over the ſame Tragical Scenes of Sacrilege, Rapine and Blood, when their Maſters ſhall get power, and opportunities agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their malice, which both ancient and modern Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have done before them; they may find juſt cauſe to grow jealous of themſelves, though they have yet the ſheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on them, and to ſuſpect their Teachers, though tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into Angels of light, for the Miniſters of Satan, whoſe deſign it is to attempt the ruine of the Church, by the abuſed zeal of her ſeduced Children, which he could not effect by the cruelty of her profeſſed Enemies. To unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch Perſons, and render Schiſme and Faction, as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pernicious, as the Scripture doth deſcribe them, and both the Hiſtory of former Ages, and the ſad experience of our own, do demonſtrate them to have been, and that all who profeſs the Name of Christ may agree in the truth of his Holy Word, and live in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with their Brethren, and in due Obedience to their lawful Governors, both in Church and State, is the only Deſign, and hearty Prayer of

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101058:10"/>Epiphanes,</hi> who did <hi>Moſaicis libris bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum indicere,</hi> he publiſheth his Edict. That the Chriſtian Churches ſhould be levelled with the ground, the Ornaments ſeized to his uſe, the Holy Scriptures conſumed in the Fire, and all that profeſſed Chriſtianity, be deprived of all Liberties, Offices, and Dignities, unleſs they would offer Sacrifice to the Heathen Gods. Immediately upon publiſhing this Edict, his Officers do generally become Inquiſitors, and ſtrictly require all the Chriſtians to deliver up the Utenſils of their Churches, and the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Lord, to be conſumed in the Fire, which, if any refuſed, they themſelves were condemned to the Flames.</p>
            <p>Among other Confeſſors, <hi>Felix</hi> Deacon of <hi>Autramitum,</hi> was ſummoned by the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,<note place="margin">Optarus p. <hi>40.</hi>
               </note> to deliver up the Ornaments of his Church, and the Evangelical Books, which were in his cuſtody; whereupon he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>Menſurius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whereof the Officers being informed, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>Menſurius</hi> to deliver him up, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on a ſet Day at the Emperors Court, to anſwer the contempt. Where it is obſervable, that <hi>(Epiſcoporum domus nè in perſecutionibus fas erat violare)</hi> the Biſhops Houſes, even in times of Perſecution, were accounted as a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary by the very Heathen. <hi>Menſurius</hi> was too much a Chriſtian to betray his Brother, and therefore he choſe rather to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Emperors ſentence, and to appear at the appointed time: but in the interim, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101058:10"/>is careful to ſecure the Goods belonging to his Church: And in thoſe Days, as the Chriſtians had Churches called <hi>Baſilicas,</hi> ſo thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es had their Ornaments. St. <hi>Auguſt. contr. Creſconium,</hi> ſays that the Church of <hi>Cirta,</hi> in the time of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> had two Chalices of Gold, ſix Cups of Silver, and a Silver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick. Yet the Treaſuries of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were much exhauſted in thoſe days, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frequent practice of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, to ſell their Plate and Ornaments, to redeem the lives, or to relieve the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their perſecuted Brethren. <hi>Menſurius</hi> therefore cauſeth an Inventory of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> to be made, and committing the Treaſury it ſelf to the cuſtody of the Elders, (as <hi>Optatus</hi> ſaith) he leaves the Inventory with an ancient Woman,<note place="margin">p. 41.</note> whom he had always found faithful, charging her to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, for his Succeſſors, if it ſhould pleaſe God to account him worthy of Martyrdom.<note n="*" place="margin">Erant in illâ Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiâ quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plurima Ornamenta Auri &amp; Argenti.</note> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, there were in that Church very many Ornaments of Gold and Silver. Concerning the Death of <hi>Menſurius,</hi> we have no certain account in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, only we find the Biſhoprick of <hi>Carthage</hi> to be void ſhortly after, and <hi>Diocleſian</hi> languiſhing under a ſurfeit of Chriſtian blood, reſigned his Empire to <hi>Maxentius,</hi> who was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown ſometime after by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as alſo <hi>Maximinus</hi> another Tyrant by <hi>Licinius,</hi> and thereupon <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Father of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> though he were then in <hi>England,</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

The flames that were kindled by Heathen Perſecutors, were ſcarcely extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when the new lights and heats raiſed by contentious and ambitious Perſons, begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother conflagration; for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Carthage</hi> being void, <hi>Botrus</hi> and <hi>Celeſius</hi> two Presbyters become Competitors for it, againſt <hi>Cecilian,</hi> who being a Perſon of known inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, was by the general ſuffrage of that whole Church choſen Biſhop, and was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Felix</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aptung.</hi> And now, the good Woman, according to the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in her, brings the Inventory of the Church-Treaſury to <hi>Cecilian,</hi> whereupon he ſummoneth thoſe Elders, to whom the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury was committed, to make reſtitution, but

The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Biſhops met at this time (they ſay) was above Seventy. The Names of the Chief St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> acquaints us with, <hi>(viz.)

            <p>Firſt therefore, he queſtioneth <hi>Donatus Maſculitanus</hi> what he could ſay, to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the accuſation of being a Traditor, which lay againſt him? <hi>Donatus</hi> anſwered, that it was well known, how violently <hi>Florus</hi> did proſecute him, to make him offer ſacrifice, but God delivered me out of his hands, and God having preſerved me, my hope is, that you will continue me in the ſervice of God. <hi>Secundus</hi> replyed, what ſhall we ſay then of he Martyrs, that choſe to indure the flames themſelves, rather than to offer a grain of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101058:12"/>to the Heathen Gods? <hi>Donatus</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I pray you to leave me to God, to whom I ſhall give an account. <hi>Secundus</hi> bids him to go on the other ſide: Then he declares, that <hi>Victor</hi> was accuſed to have delivered the Four Evangeliſts to be conſumed in the Fire. <hi>Victor</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Valentianus</hi> being <hi>Curator</hi> compelled him to caſt them into the Fire, and that the Books were ſo blotted and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that they were almoſt uſeleſs, and if you pardon me for this, I hope God will do the like. <hi>Secundus</hi> bids him go on the other ſide. Then was <hi>Marinus</hi> accuſed for delivering up his Books, he anſwered, I gave ſome Books to <hi>Pollus,</hi> but the chiefeſt of them are ſafe: <hi>Secundus</hi> bids him go on the other ſide. The next that was queſtioned was <hi>Purpurius,</hi> for deſtroying his Siſters two Sons, with whom <hi>Secundus</hi> dealing more ſeverely than with the reſt; Do you think, ſaith <hi>Purpurius,</hi> to affright me, as you have done others?

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101058:17"/>with Ten of his Accuſers, and Ten others, whom he ſhall chooſe on his behalf, do Sail to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I have appointed <hi>Meltiades</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with <hi>Rheticius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> and <hi>Maternus</hi> Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> to hear and judge of the differences in queſtion. You cannot be ignorant, that I would have you ſuffer no Schiſme, in any part of the Church. The Great God preſerve you. Theſe Biſhops met at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Fauſta</hi> in the <hi>Laterane. Meltiades</hi> took to his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance Fifteen <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops to aſſiſt for the expedition of the cauſe. Theſe with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, heard all that was objected againſt <hi>Cecilian, Donatus</hi> himſelf being preſent. The Biſhops alſo agreed to take publick Notaries, for the more orderly and ſpeedy diſpatch, that the examinations and proofs in this cauſe, might be reduced into publick Acts. The firſt thing that was inquired, was, who were the Accuſers, and what Witneſſes were preſent to give Evidence againſt <hi>Cecilian?</hi> To which, the Party of <hi>Donatus</hi> anſwered, that their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was contained in the Libels, which they had preſented to the Emperor, and by him were tranſmitted to them, which they deſired might be read. One of the Libels was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed thus: <hi>Libellus Eccleſiae Catholicae, &amp;c.</hi> A Libel of the Catholick Church: (ſo they called their Faction) containing the Crimes whereof <hi>Cecilian</hi> is accuſed. What was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Libel, is not particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by any Author, nor are Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101058:18"/>Writers agreed, concerning the charge then in queſtion. Thoſe, who in this laſt Century, have defended the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſay, that nothing came in queſtion, beſides the grounds of the Schiſme, on pretence, that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> himſelf was a <hi>Traditor.</hi> And hereby they hope to avoid the Appeal, which was made from the ſentence of the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the Emperor, becauſe (ſay they) the queſtions diſcuſſed afterward in the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> were of a divers nature from thoſe at <hi>Rome;</hi> but of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>It is very probable that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had ſtuffed their Libel with more than a ſingle accuſation, ſome particulars whereof, I ſhall give an account. The Libel being read, it was demanded, who were <hi>Cecilian</hi>'s Accuſers? They anſwered, the People of <hi>Carthage.</hi> It was replyed, that the Voice of the People aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in a tumultuary manner, was not a ſufficient ground to condemn any, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhops ordered them to produce ſome competent Witneſſes, to atteſt the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Whereupon <hi>Donatus</hi> produced ſome Perſons whom he brought with him from <hi>Carthage,</hi> to depoſe againſt <hi>Cecilian.</hi> The Charge againſt him was high: <hi>(viz.)</hi> That while <hi>Cecilian</hi> was a Deacon under <hi>Menſurius,</hi> he was ſet by <hi>Menſurius</hi> near the Priſon Doors, where many Catholicks lay, who were appointed to ſuffer Martyrdome, and did by force (<hi>Loris &amp; flagris &amp; Armatorum multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine</hi>) withſtand ſuch Friends, as came to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101058:18"/>comfort and relieve them. To this the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for <hi>Donatus,</hi> being examined, could ſay nothing on their Perſonal knowledge, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the report of the People: This <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> urged againſt <hi>Parmenian,</hi> p. 36. <hi>Nullis certis perſonis aut nominibus Traditores accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis.</hi> The ſecond Article inſiſted on, was, That <hi>Cecilian</hi> was condemned by a Synod of 70. Biſhops at <hi>Cirta,</hi> who being all of them Neighbours to <hi>Carthage,</hi> could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the matters of fact whereof they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that they judged that both <hi>Cecilian,</hi> and <hi>Menſurius</hi> his Predeceſſor, and <hi>Felix</hi> who ordained <hi>Cecilian,</hi> were Traditors. To which <hi>Cecilian</hi> replyed, that he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Aſſembly, being abſent and unheard: That he could not without great hazard of his life, appear among them, who being his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemies, made themſelves his Judges: That many of them were corrupted by the Money of <hi>Lucilla</hi> to Vote againſt him, and that generally they were ſuch as had confeſſed themſelves to have been Traditors, but had abſolved one another: And alſo, that he had received many threatning Meſſages from ſome of them, eſpecially from <hi>Purpurius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Limatia.</hi> Laſtly, That they had long before, held private Conferences among themſelves, how to deſtroy him, as well as to depoſe him, of which things he was adviſed by ſeveral Catholick People, who were ready to atteſt the ſame, and by their advice he did forbear to appear. The next Article was, that <hi>Felix</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101058:19"/>who ordained <hi>Cecilian</hi> was a Traditor, and ſo his Ordination was null. But this the Biſhops thought not fit to inquire into, <hi>Felix</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, nor having been at any time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by any Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, and ſo long he had a lawful Power of Ordination. And as in the caſe of Baptiſme, the Cathol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For, if <hi>Meltiades</hi> was called to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Controverſie, by a delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Power, it will neceſſarily follow, (ſaith <hi>Albaſpinaeus,</hi> in the fourth Obſervation on <hi>Optatus</hi>) that the <hi>Popes</hi> in thoſe days were not Univerſal Paſtors, nor had the Supreme Authority of determining Eccleſiaſtical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And the reaſon of the conſequence is evident, for he that ſubmits to the command of another, doth <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> confeſs that he is not Supreme, nor will the Supreme Judge ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his determinations to be reſcinded by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Power. Now it is not denied, 1. That <hi>Meltiades</hi> did ſit together with the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops at the Emperor's command: 2. And that <hi>Silveſter</hi> his Succeſſor did afterward ſend his Delegates into <hi>France,</hi> by the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. 3. That the Emperor did appoint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops to ſit with <hi>Meltiades:</hi> and <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades</hi> did joyn with them as coordinate, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101058:20"/>he would not have done, if the Supreme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer had been his own. 4. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did Appeal (thinking themſelves aggrieved) from the Sentence of <hi>Meltiades</hi> and his Colleagues to the Emperor. <hi>Optatus</hi> is ſo plain herein, that <hi>Valeſius [de Schiſmate Donatistarum]</hi> could find no other evaſion, but to ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Optat.</hi> p. 44.</note> that <hi>Optatus</hi> is corrupted in that place; the words are, <hi>Donatus appellandum eſſe ab Epiſcopis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit:</hi> but he ſaith leſs againſt the ſecond Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, from the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, where the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Delegates being ſent, (<hi>Silvester</hi> the preſent <hi>Pope</hi> being himſelf not able to be preſent) did acknowledge, that they were <hi>Voluntate Imperatoris adducti:</hi> and <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> grants, that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Biſhops did take place of the Delegates, as appears by their Subſcriptions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Emperor did underſtand it as an Appeal, and acted accordingly; for he did not only appoint ſuch Judges as were deſired, but at laſt determined the caſe in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and tells the World, that he thought it his duty ſo to do: for writing to <hi>Ablavius,</hi> he ſays: <q rend="margQuotes">If he ſhould neglect to put an end to thoſe Diviſions, the Supreme Deity might juſtly be diſpleaſed with Mankind, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with him, to whoſe care, by the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command, the moderation of all earthly things was committed.</q> The like he ſaith in an Epiſtle to <hi>Celſus,</hi> his Lieutenant in <hi>Africa,</hi>

            <p>This Donation is ſaid to be made to Pope <hi>Silvester</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Third of the Calends of <hi>April. Augusto Conſtantino 4<hi rend="sup">to,</hi> &amp; Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano 4<hi rend="sup">to.</hi> Coſſ.</hi> The Original is pretended to have been found, written in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, in the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> among other old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, by <hi>Bartholomaeus Pincernus,</hi> who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it into <hi>Latine,</hi> and preſented it to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second. The occaſion of it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Grant it ſelf, is ſaid to be this, That <hi>Conſtantine</hi> having revolted from the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101058:22"/>Chriſtian Religion, and perſecuted many of the Biſhops, he was ſmitten with a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Leproſie all over his Body, and having tried many phyſicians in vain, he was at length adviſed by the Prieſts of the Capitol, to ſlay ſo many Infants as ſhould fill a Ciſtern with their bloud, and bath himſelf therein, while it was warm; but being moved at the cries of the Mothers of thoſe Infants, that were appointed to be ſlain, he reſolved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to indure his Diſeaſe; and the Night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had diſmiſſed the Infants, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> appeared to him, and diſcovered a ſurer Remedy, which was, that he ſhould ſend for <hi>Silveſter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who for fear of the Perſecution raiſed by <hi>Constantine,</hi> had hid himſelf in the Caves of the Mountain <hi>Soracte,</hi> and by him his Leproſie ſhould be cured. Hereupon <hi>Silvester</hi> is brought to him, and the firſt queſtion, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is there ſaid to ask him, was, Who thoſe Gods were that were called <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and whether he had any Pictures of them, whereby they might be known? <hi>Silvester</hi> preſently ſent his Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, to bring the Pictures of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> at the ſight of which, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> knew them to be the ſame that appeared to him in his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and had willed him to ſend for <hi>Silveſter.</hi> To him he therefore confeſſed his ſins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his advice for his health. The <hi>Pope</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns him for certain Days to go in Sackcloth, within the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and afterward to receive the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and then he ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101058:23"/>be whole. Accordingly <hi>Constantine</hi> ſubmits to the Penance, and prepares for his Baptiſm; And being in the Holy Font, he ſaw a Hand ſtretched from Heaven to ſupport and cleanſe him; and being baptized by <hi>Silvester,</hi> he came forth ſound, and clean from his Diſeaſe; Then was he clothed in white, and anointed with Chriſme, and had the <hi>Pope</hi>'s benediction, which was, <hi>Pax tibi,</hi> and all the Clergy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Amen.</hi> The moſt of theſe particulars are mentioned by <hi>Baronius, Anno Constan.</hi> 19. But nothing of the Donation it ſelf.</p>
            <p>After this he makes a large confeſſion of his Faith, which he had learned <hi>à Catholico Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchâ,</hi> (i. e.) from the <hi>Pope;</hi> And the fourth Day after his Baptiſm, He confirmed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Wherein he granted that all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſhould honour the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as their King, whoſe Throne he exalted above his own, giving him <hi>Imperial Dignity and Principality, as well above the four Sees of Alexandria, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Hieruſalem and Conſtantinople, as above all other Churches:</hi> He grants him alſo his Imperial Palace of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and taking a Crown of Gold, ſet with precious Stones, offered to put it on his Head, but the good <hi>Pope</hi> (as the ſtory ſays) refuſed that, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only a white Coronet; and to maintain his dignity, he gave him, not only his Palace, but the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Cities and Provinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> (<hi>Concedimus &amp; relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> we grant and yield up as the words are) and thereupon the Emperor transfer'd his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101058:23"/>Court from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> which he builded and called after his own name <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and bound all his Succeſſors under a Curſe (which was <hi>habeant Petrum &amp; Paulum ſibi contrarios</hi>) not to violate any part of this grant. I think it not fit to tire my Readers patience, to give a full Copy of all the <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> given to the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Lorum ſuperhume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale, quod Imperiale collum aſſolet circundare, Chlamidem purpureum, Tunicam coccineam &amp; omnia Imperialia Sceptra, Signa &amp; Banna</hi>— And how he appointed all Officers to attend the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he was attended in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that the Clergy ſhould be honoured, after the ſame manner, as the Senators of the Emperor were, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doubtleſs <hi>Pincernus</hi> (or ſome other that impoſed on him) wrote a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Pomp of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he ſaw in the days of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, and not of what was intended by <hi>Constantine:</hi> for if that noble Emperor had given the <hi>Pope</hi> any of thoſe Dominions, he would not have left them to his Children and Succeſſors, who ſtill had them in poſſeſſion for many Hundred Years after, all which time we hear nothing of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s claim, in the days of <hi>Conſtantius, Valentinian, Theodoſius, Arcadius, Honorius, &amp;c.</hi> Some of which were ſo pious, that they would not have Uſurped the Rights of the Church, and by violating the Will of their Renowned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor, incur the Curſe of God.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned many <hi>Latine</hi> words
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101058:24"/>in this Donation, becauſe from them (which are of a later Date, than the time of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>) the Divines of the Reformed Churches, have raiſed ſhrew'd ſuſpicions of forgery: to evade which, the <hi>Romanists</hi> plead, that theſe were to be imputed to the Tranſlator, who rendred it from the <hi>Greek,</hi> but the Original (if there be any) is kept ſo ſecret in the <hi>Pope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Archives, that the greateſt Favourites are not admitted to ſee it; and doubtleſs, if it had been publiſhed, there would have been more objected againſt the Original, than againſt the Tranſlation: For it is very unlikely, that the grant ſhould be made in an unknown Tongue; for <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">l. <hi>3.</hi> de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ Conſt.</note> that at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was this very Biſhop, ſpake <hi>Latine:</hi> And the Decrees and Epiſtles of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> were generally written in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue,<note place="margin">

Nor do they tell us of his Apoſtaſie and Perſecution of the Church, nor of his Leproſie Cured at his Baptiſm, which was not long before his Death, and that, not by <hi>Silveſter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> but by <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> in the 65.

            <p>And laſtly, it is ſtrange, that none of thoſe Authors, that have written the Hiſtory of his Empire and Actions, many of which I have conſulted in compiling this his Hiſtory, ſhould ſay any thing of his revolt to Idolatry; but on the contrary, do all agree in his conſtant care of the Church, and defending it againſt Hereſie and Schiſme. Eſpecially conſidering his early inſtitution in the Chriſtian Faith, and the many Victories which he obtained in the Name of Chriſt, whom he was wont ſolemnly to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate before his Battles, as he did in the Fight with <hi>Maxentius,</hi> in anſwer to whoſe Prayers, there appeared in the Heavens, to the view of all his Army, the Sign of the Croſs, with this Motto, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and accordingly <hi>Maxentius</hi> was overthrown at the River <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> wherein he and a great part of his Army periſhed. And thereupon the Emperor did bear this Sign afterward in his Standard, and ſtamped it on ſeveral Coins. This ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice concerning that fable: I return now to the Hiſtory. The Emperor, as you have heard, yielding to the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> importunity, and to leave them without excuſe, appoints a Council to meet at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and being at that time, as <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, on the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> intended to be preſent at it; Accordingly he ſignified his pleaſure to <hi>Silveſter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Marinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> and to <hi>Chreſtus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> and generally to all the chief Biſhops in his ſeveral Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that each of them taking to them two
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101058:25"/>other Biſhops whom they ſhould chooſe, ſhould haſten to <hi>Arles:</hi> The Number of the Biſhops (as St. <hi>Auguſt. contra Parmen.</hi>) was Two Hundred, ſome ſay 600. ſo <hi>Baronius,</hi> from whom Dr. <hi>Heylen</hi> tells us, that <hi>Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> was there preſent: <hi>Marinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles</hi> ſate Preſident, though <hi>Fr.

The time of Aſſembling being come, the Emperor meets the Biſhops, and commanding off his Guards, ſets Himſelf in the midſt of them, and acquaints them that to ſatisfie the importunity of <hi>Donatus,</hi> who complained of partiality in the Sentence at <hi>Rome,</hi> where (as he pretended) a few Biſhops having ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up, <hi>Cauſâ non ſatis cognita ſententiam praecipitabant,</hi> did precipitate judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inquiring into the merits of the cauſe; He had called them to conſult and determine of the differences, that had miſerably divided the Churches of <hi>Africa:</hi> and ſetting before them the Proceedings in this cauſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> he alſo adds the purgation of <hi>Felix,</hi> who had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cecilian,</hi> which by the Emperor's care and direction, was diſpatched about four Moneths before, by <hi>Aelian</hi> his Proconſul in <hi>Africa;</hi> for the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had alledged at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Felix</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aptung</hi> was a Traditor, and they pretended that this particular was not examined at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that it was the opinion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101058:25"/>of the Church, that the Ordination by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors was null; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> therefore ſent to <hi>Aelian,</hi> to enquire into the Life and Actions of <hi>Felix,</hi> which he did with great care and integrity, taking to his aſſiſtance <hi>Saturnius,</hi> who had been <hi>Curator</hi> of the City, while <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> lived, and ſo probably was beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the behaviour of <hi>Felix;</hi> and <hi>Gratianus</hi> the preſent Curator, <hi>Alfius Ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus a Duum-Vir</hi> in the time of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and others.

Then was produced by the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> one <hi>Ingentius</hi> a Notary, to teſtifie that he had ſeen certain Letters in the hands of <hi>Alfius Cecilian,</hi> which expreſſed the guilt of <hi>Felix,</hi> as a Traditor; which being produced (and they are yet on record in <hi>Baronius</hi>) upon examination, and the teſtimony of <hi>Alfius Cecilianus</hi> concerning them, they were found to be forged, and thereupon <hi>Ingentius</hi> was condemned to the puniſhment, called <hi>Equuleius,</hi> unleſs he would confeſs who had perſwaded him to that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: The terror of that puniſhment (which was in the nature of a Rack, for two pieces of Timber being joyned together, the Offender was ſtretched out at length, and his Hands and Feet tyed faſt to the Timber, which being joyned in the middle by a Skrue, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners extended it to the racking of every Joynt, and if the Offender did not confeſs,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101058:26"/>they added hot Irons and Pincers, to burn and rent his Fleſh) did ſo prevail with <hi>Ingentius,</hi> that he confeſſed that he had forged thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, at the inſtigation of ſome of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts;</hi> and thereupon he was committed to the Cuſtody of <hi>Petronius Probianus,</hi> to be ſent to the Emperor, by whom being examined, he acknowledged the Fact, and implored his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. But the Emperor was ſo provoked at this, that he called the <hi>Donatiſts, Officinam Diaboli,</hi> the Devil's ſhop.</p>
            <p>Together with <hi>Ingentius,</hi> the Emperor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a full account of the innocency of <hi>Felix,</hi> and relates the whole buſineſs to the Council; ſo that this Objection being anſwered, there was no conſiderable Article added <hi>de Novo,</hi> for the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did, <hi>Eandem cantilenam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> only revive their old ſlanders, by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new impudence and malice in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them. So that the Council having with great patience heard the clamors and falſe accuſations of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Cecilian,</hi> condemning his Accuſers, and appointed the 14th.

            <p>Theſe ſubtile Perſons were content to be baffled abroad, while their Party was ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at home, and to animate them, they alway ſent home falſe reports of the condemnation of <hi>Cecilian;</hi> and when theſe were refuted, of the partiality of the Judges, ſo that their Numbers did ſtill increaſe, notwithſtanding the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Council againſt them; they had the far greater part of the People, and above Two Hundred Biſhops to ſtrengthen them. And whereas they pleaded formerly for themſelves, that Chriſt's Flock was a little Flock, and did not act but ſuffer perſecution, their ſucceſs had furniſhed them with other Arguments, and with Armes too, for now they begin to boaſt, that none are ſo Catholick as themſelves, and their Brethren find, that none are ſo cruel as they; for being much increaſed, they will not be confined to <hi>Africa</hi> any longer.</p>

            <p>Indeed the Emperor, though he was both wiſe and valiant, had great difficulties to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Senatui morem gereret:</hi> On the other hand the Number of Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which exceeded that of the Catholicks in divers Countries, gave another check to his Authority—<hi>Nos Numerus ſumus &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no dominamur Atridi.</hi> They were ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that upon their revolt all <hi>Africa</hi> was in danger of being loſt. And here we ſhall obſerve, that in all theſe Councils, nothing was to be determined, but the caſe of Schiſme, as both <hi>Optatus</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> have recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that is, whether <hi>Cecilian</hi> or <hi>Donatus</hi> were the true Paſtor and Governor of the Church, for we hear not of any diſſent in point of Doctrine, <hi>Pares credimus &amp; uno ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillo ſignati ſumus: nec aliter Baptizati,</hi>

And it is alſo remarkable, that, though many Hereſies were at this time vented in the Church, as the <hi>Novatian, Macedonian, Audaean, Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> too, yet none did ſo much afflict the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> as this Schiſm: againſt which, as <hi>Optatus</hi> ſpent all his labour, ſo St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote at leaſt one of thoſe great Volumes, which the Church of GOD doth now injoy.</p>
            <p>The good Emperor, notwithſtanding that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had defeated ſo many of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for Peace, was reſolved to trie one more, which was to call in ſome of the Eaſtern Biſhops to joyn with thoſe of the Weſt, as he intimates in an Epiſtle written to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the other Biſhops of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> who alſo ſays, that the Emperor was much blamed for his too great indulgence toward theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Spirits: But if the neceſſity of his affairs be conſidered, it will appear, that he could not do otherwiſe: for having out of his Chriſtian clemency condeſcended ſo far to them, they take advantage of ſome unhappy Circumſtances to force him farther.</p>

The <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie alſo was ſpread over <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Torrent overflowed the Chriſtian World. Of which Hereſie it will not be impertinent to give a brief Account, becauſe many of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> to ſtrengthen their Faction againſt the Catholicks, joyned with them; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the deſcent from Schiſme to Hereſie, is very facile and familiar.—<hi>Arius</hi> a <hi>Presbyter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> appeared about the Year 315. He was bred up under <hi>Meletius</hi> a Presbyter, while <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> by whom <hi>Arius</hi> was made Deacon: but being found to have maintained Opinions contrary to the Catholick Faith, both he and <hi>Meletius,</hi> that had corrupted him, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. <hi>Meletius</hi> perſiſted in his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Opinions, That Chriſt was not the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, but a very Man, <hi>Ex utro<expan>

Thus as from Schiſme to Hereſie, ſo from Hereſie to Infidelity and Atheiſme, the paſſage is obvious. <hi>Arius</hi> refined this Opinion of his Maſter, and differed but in one Letter from the Catholicks, teaching that Chriſt was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, of the ſame ſubſtance, and ought to receive the ſame Worſhip with the Father; <hi>Arius</hi> taught that he was indeed the Son of God, and more excellent than the other Creatures, but that he was not from Eternity, but made <hi>Ex praeexiſtentibus,</hi> of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent, and did not partake of the ſubſtance of the Father, nor was of equal dignity and power, but that the Son was inferior to the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt inferior to the Son, by whom he was made.

            <p>And whereas ſome of them had been denied the liberty of exerciſing their Functions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publickly or privately, and others bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for tranſgreſſing the Laws, and inforced to return to ſecular imployments, they urge that their baniſhed may be recalled, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that <hi>Silvanus</hi> one of their Biſhops, of whom we have ſpoken before, might return.

               <hi>Gratus</hi> and <hi>Parmenian</hi> are the two Biſhops that were in competition, <hi>Anno</hi> 368. Of what temper <hi>Parmenian</hi> was, <hi>Optatus</hi> his Cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, a Perſon greatly beloved, as well for his Piety as Learning, hath ſhewn at large.

In his days <hi>Ticonius,</hi> one of the moſt learned and ſober of that Party, reading and weighing the Arguments of <hi>Optatus</hi> for the Catholick Church, was ſo far convinced, that he wrote in defence of it, confuting the Arguments of the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> and aſſerting, that <hi>(nullius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis peccatum poteſt praeſcribere promiſſis Dei)</hi> the wickedneſs of Man cannot make void the promiſes of God, concerning the extent of Chriſt's Church, for which he was condemned by a Synod of their Biſhops, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer to his Arguments. Now the great confuſion which was at <hi>Carthage,</hi> drove St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (who was yet a Heathen) to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he read Rhetorick, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,

The Decretals of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> made about this time, againſt the <hi>Donatists,</hi> are ſtill on Record.

               <hi>(hoc unum agebant ut nil ageretur)</hi> make uſe of all poſſible cavils, and ſubterfuges, as if the chief buſineſs that they had to do, were to take care that nothing might be done, and to return with as much Pride and Pomp as they came. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they object, that the time appointed was elapſed; then, that there was no certain Date to the Imperial Edict, becauſe the Names of the Conſuls were not inſerted. Theſe being anſwered, they deſire to know who procured the Edict for that Meeting, that the Names of the Legates, and their Petition might be read; tacitely reflecting upon the Catholicks, (ſaith St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) for referring the cauſe of the Church to the Emperor. To this it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the Catholicks (who confeſſed that they procured it) had done no other, than they themſelves appealing from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Meltiades</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Cecilian,</hi> unto the Emperor <hi>Constantine.</hi> Then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reflect on the Perſons of <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian,</hi> and having almoſt tired <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> to keep them from impertinencies, repetitions and evaſions, he brought them at laſt to the merits of the cauſe. But, <hi>Quid dignum tanto?</hi> I know not any thing that may raiſe greater admiration, than to conſider what trifles, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101058:57"/>apples of contention, like the forbidden fruit, ingaged all <hi>Africa</hi> in ſuch deſperate fewds, as made it an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> for blood-ſhed and ſlaughters, and imployed ſo many Emperors, Biſhops and Councils, for more than an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years together, without any conſiderable effect. For when the differences and cauſes of that confuſion came to be conſidered in this Conference, we do not hear that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> could plead in juſtification of their Schiſme, that their ſuppoſed Enemies did deny God, or Chriſt, or the Reſurrection, or did actually perſecute them, or that they did with pride, and contempt, deny to admit them to their Communion; nor did the Catholicks charge the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> with Apoſtaſie from the Faith, and denying Fundamentals of Chriſtianity: We do not hear them urging, as they might, their rebaptizing and joyning with the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> againſt thoſe whom they knew to be Orthodox Biſhops. They all profeſſed an agreement in all ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points of Faith, that it is ſtrange, how they could differ in any thing; And yet the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> perſecuted the Catholicks ſo cruelly, as if they had not been agreed in any principle of Chriſtianity. <hi>Marcellinus</hi> having heard the whole Conference, declared againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and charged the inferior Officers ſpeedily to execute the Imperial Laws, in ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing their Churches for the Catholicks, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Conventicles, and confiſcating their Meeting places; which Edict the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors

In the mean time, he prevailed with them to ſubſcribe the Records of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which had been faithfully taken, by the Notaries on both ſides, and ſo diſmiſſed them. After the Publication of this Conference, and of the Emperor's reinforcing the Laws for pecuniary Mulcts, and Baniſhment againſt them; ſome Thouſands of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deſerted them, and returned to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and to their honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful callings, which they had long omitted, as generally the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> did: But the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natist</hi> Biſhops and Presbyters were for the moſt part obſtinate, and endeavoured to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Schiſme. There were many impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemned for Murther, and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, committed in that Tumult, wherein <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutus</hi> and <hi>Innocentius</hi> were ſlain; for theſe St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> mediates, and obtains Pardon.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101058:59"/>But the <hi>Donatist</hi> Biſhops return in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and report among the People, that they were not permitted to ſpeak with that liberty and freedome, as they ought: And <hi>Petilian,</hi> who went off from the Conference, before it was ended, having loſt his Voice by raving and paſſion, pretended afterward, that he was diſſatisfied with the partiality of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus;</hi> and therefore he perſwaded the reſt to Appeal from his Sentence, pretending that they had been kept as Priſoners, and were not ſuffered to proſecute their Arguments; and that <hi>Marcellinus</hi> was corrupted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Sentence at Midnight, which was contrary to Law. And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> going afterward to <hi>Mauritania,</hi> was challenged by <hi>Emeritus,</hi> one of the <hi>Donatist</hi> Biſhops, who undertook to defend the Conference, in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal diſputation, which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agreed to, and hath given us a particular account of it. But as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hoc proprium Donatistis eandem cantilenam canere:</hi> It was their cuſtome to inculcate the ſame Arguments again, which had been often confuted many Years before.</p>
            <p>There being no reformation among the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Faction, who continue ſeveral Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Cruelties and Murthers: Thirty of their Biſhops were condemned to be baniſhed, who met together, and reſolved rather to caſt themſelves over the Precipices, (as the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> was) and to dye Martyrs for the cauſe. And ſome did deſtroy

In ſo much that <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citius,</hi> who was joyned with <hi>Marcellinus</hi> in the Government of <hi>Africa,</hi> adviſed with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> what was moſt fit to be done with thoſe obſtinate Perſons, that ſtill ſeduced the People; and what counſel St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gave him, we read in the 61.

               <p>The <hi>Luciferians,</hi> as the moſt moderate, ſhall have precedency: Theſe were ſo called from <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> who
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101058:60"/>in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was a zealous Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Catholick Faith againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> for which he was baniſhed while they had the power: He is commended for it, by <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Hilarion,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome.</hi> When the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were ſuppreſſed, he was recalled, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his Biſhoprick: but perceiving that many of the <hi>Arians</hi> were on very eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions admitted to the Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made capable of Eccleſiaſtical Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he was much diſſatisfied, and denyed to hold Communion with the Church, for being ſo charitable to thoſe new Converts. He therefore lays the Foundation of his Schiſme in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> where the Catholicks ſolicite him, by all gentle and rational means, not to divide that Church whoſe Faith and unity he had ſo ſtrenuouſly aſſerted; but finding that he was not only reſolutely obſtinate, but indefatigably induſtrious to propagate the Schiſme, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks thought fit to ſuſpend him, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate his adherents. Whereupon he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports himſelf into <hi>Africa,</hi> whither great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his perſwaſion follow him, and joyn themſelves to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> but kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a diſtinct Faction, in this reſpect, that they did not rebaptize, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> generally did: but their Pride and contempt of the Catholicks, was in a ſhort time equal to that of the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them for not renouncing their Baptiſm, but condemns them as much for cutting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off from the Catholick unity, and much

Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> therefore comparing theſe <hi>Donatiſts</hi> with the <hi>Novatians,</hi> calls them both, <hi>Non Eccleſiam Chriſti, ſed Antichriſti Synagogam.</hi> Theſe <hi>Luciferians</hi> ſtood as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Congregations, or any of the other Factions, which were generally Anabaptiſtical: For they did not only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize the adult that came over to them, but refuſed to baptize Children, contrary to the practice of the Church, as appears by ſeveral diſcourſes of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> The moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sect of all, were the <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> who were as ſo many Hectors, to fight for the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> on all occaſions. Theſe were the Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, which did abound in every faction, and pretended to higher diſpenſations, than their Brethren: for they believed, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God, to act and ſuffer extraordinary
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101058:61"/>things, which they were ready to attempt, as often as their Brethren, or their own luſts did prompt them thereunto. They met ſometime in leſſer, and ſometime in greater Numbers, either as Robbers, to abuſe and plunder all that were not of their own Perſwaſion: Slaves would rob their Maſters, and Debtors would force their Creditors to deliver up their Obligations, and had the perfect Principles of <hi>Levellers,</hi> holding that none had right to any of their Poſſeſſions, but by partaking of the ſame Faith, and Profeſſion with themſelves. <hi>Dominium fundatur in gratiâ,</hi> was their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime. Or elſe they would meet in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers well armed, and able to affront the chief Armies of the Emperor: And were often the Aggreſſors, provoking the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers to their own deſtruction. Thus they ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Macarius,</hi> who were ſent with Preſents to the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> from the Emperor <hi>Conſtans,</hi> who being aſſiſted by the Proconſul, ſlew great Numbers of them. Theſe were animated by their Leaders, who were generally <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhops, and called <hi>Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Duces,</hi> Captains of the Saints, and were animated by a Perſwaſion, that as many as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a violent Death, in defence of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were Martyrs:<note place="margin">Optat. p. <hi>146.</hi>
                  </note> and accordingly, Altars were built to their Memorial, and Prayers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up on thoſe Altars. Theſe <hi>Circumcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had a Solemn initiation; for having devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to violent Deaths, (which they ſometimes voluntarily executed on themſelves,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101058:61"/>or at the command of their Brethren) their Neighbours and Relations gave them all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reſpect and attendance, ſo that nothing was denied to them for their encouragement, that like ſo many fatted Beaſts, they might be fit for the ſlaughter, rather than for a Sacrifice, which yet they were perſwaded, that they were offering up to God in an acceptable manner. And as oft as they declared themſelves ready for ſuch deſperate deſigns, their Brethren aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and prayed, and gave thanks for that ſupernatural and heroick ſpirit, wherewith they were inſpired. Being thus in a moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical manner initiated, they would go forth ſometime armed, ſometimes unarmed, but reſolved to provoke whomſoever they met with, railing, beating, and wounding them; ſometime ſlaying others, or ſuffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſlain; and if this hapned not, they would caſt themſelves into deep Wells, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver high Precipices, to their certain deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Sometimes theſe <hi>Circumcellians</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in great Numbers: <hi>Sub specie Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rapientium latrocinantes;</hi> playing the Robbers under pretence of Martyrs, as <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> obſerves: or elſe really attempting ſuch acts of Hoſtility upon the Catholicks, their Houſes, and Churches, or upon the Emperor's Souldiers, as cauſed the ruine of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.<note place="margin">De fabutis Haereticor.

                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us of a Company of theſe, who went abroad armed, and reſolved to run this mad race, and meeting with a young Man unarmed, they were ſo humane, as not to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101058:62"/>deſtroy him with ſuch unequal Numbers, wherefore they all agreed, that they would deliver their Weapons to him, to wound and kill them, as he pleaſed; but threatned him alſo that if he did not execute them, they would miſerably deſtroy him. The young Man ſeems to accept of the Conditions, only he tells them, it was fit they ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be bound, not only that he might the better ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their deſires, but alſo becauſe he feared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when he had ſhed the blood of ſome of the Brethren, the ſurvivors might, to preſerve their own lives, take away his. They therefore do all agree to this, as a reaſonable propoſal, and forthwith ſubmit themſelves to be bound and fettered by the young Man, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done, with as much skill as he could, he firſt deſtroyed moſt of their Weapons, and then beats them ſoundly with the reſt, and ſo departs, leaving them in their bonds, to be mocked and derided by the Paſſengers. This phrenſie they thought a very high Enthuſiaſme, but <hi>Malus Daemon iſtam phreneſim immiſit;</hi> it was the Devil, (that was a Murtherer from the beginning) that inſpired it. There were two mad Captains of theſe Martyrs of the Devil, that, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſays, were <hi>inſtar Coryban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; furentes &amp; debacchantes,</hi> like the Prieſts of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> drunk with fury, and led on great Numbers of the <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> to deſtroy as far as they went, all ſorts of Men, Women, and Children, burning Houſes and Churches, razing the Altars, and caſting the Bibles into
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101058:62"/>the Fire. With ſome ſuch <hi>Donatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bagaia</hi> aſſaulted <hi>Macarius</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> who having the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers to guard them, ſlew great Numbers of them, whom being deſtroyed, he afterward diſowned, and denyed them Burial; and at laſt caſt himſelf headlong, and periſhed in a Well. You have heard formerly of <hi>Salvius,</hi> a Biſhop of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who made another Faction among the <hi>Membreſitans.</hi> He built a Church for his Party, and kept a ſeparate Congregation for a while, but being abandoned by the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> who condemned him in a Synod of theirs, was left to the fury of the mad <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> who, as you have heard, hung dead Dogs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Neck, and danced about him,<note place="margin">Auguſt. l. <hi>3.</hi> cont.

This Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, they would excuſe, becauſe he was condemned by a full Synod of Biſhops; to which he replies, That if he ſuffered juſtly, being condemned by their Biſhops, they ought not to repine and murmur it they alſo ſuffered, who were ſo often condemned by the Biſhops of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and deſireth them to conſider, <hi>Priùs quid faciunt, deinde quid patiuntur:</hi> Firſt what they do againſt others, and then what they ſuffer from others. The Hiſtory of the <hi>Maximianiſts</hi> you have had already; I ſhall now acquaint you with another Faction, which they had eſtabliſhed at <hi>Rome,</hi> for when they perceived that they could not Anſwer the Arguments of the Catholicks, for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality of Chriſt's Church, and conſidered
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101058:63"/>how numerous they were in all <hi>Africa,</hi> they ſent their Emiſſaries abroad, and eſpecially at <hi>Rome</hi> they had planted ſome of their Faction, ſo that at length they pretended, that no Party were more Catholick than themſelves. <hi>Victor</hi> was ſetled as the Titular Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the days of <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> his Succeſſors were, Firſt, <hi>Bonifacius Balatenſis:</hi> 2. <hi>Encolpius:</hi> 3. <hi>Macrobius.</hi> 4. <hi>Lucianus.</hi> 5. <hi>Claudianus:</hi> who lived in the days of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But as both <hi>Optatus</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſay, they could pretend no higher than <hi>Victor,</hi> whereas the Churches of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> could derive their Succeſſion from the Apoſtles.

               <p>Another Opinion of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> was, that the Church of Chriſt ought to conſiſt only of ſuch as were Holy and Undefiled.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101058:72"/>they might perceive, Chriſt firſt reſtraining, and then teaching him— And our Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Gueſts to be firſt invited, and upon refuſal, to be compelled to his great Supper.

               <p>It may here be ſeaſonable to Anſwer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which is made by ſome Perſons, for Liberty of Conſcience, and againſt the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Penal Laws in the Cauſe of Religion, which I am obliged to take notice of, becauſe it particularly aſſerts, that none of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors, through whoſe Lives I have drawn the Series of this Hiſtory, did enact any Laws, or uſe any force for the Suppreſſion of Sectaries, or Hereticks, but granted them all a free Toleration. Dr. <hi>Stubs</hi> improved this Objection to the utmoſt, in a Treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate in things of Spiritual concernment, which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I hope he hath put among his Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did ſome Opinions of the like nature.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I wonder why he ſhould mention, <hi>p.</hi> 4th. that Law of the Twelve Tables, <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratìm nemo habeſſit Deos, neve novos, ſed nec advenas, nifi publice adſcitos, privatim colunto;</hi> (the breach whereof the <hi>Romans</hi> often puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Death) unleſs he thought the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101058:74"/>Magiſtrate leſs obliged to take care of the true Religion, than the Heathen were of a falſe. It being matter of fact, which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to Anſwer, I might confute the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as the Philoſopher did him, that denied motion, by riſing up and walking before him) by tranſcribing the ſeveral Imperial Laws, made to reſtrain both Schiſmes and Hereſies, which I ſhall add by themſelves hereafter, and ſhall now reflect on thoſe, which he ſays, were made in favour of them. And firſt, I ſay, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, with St. <hi>Auguſt. contra Parmen: Nec pro pro iis aliquid promulgaſſe quis invenitur, niſi Julianus Apostata.</hi> That <hi>Constantine</hi> was he firſt that publiſhed many Edicts againſt them, (which have been particularly mentioned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) and that none, but <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, may be found to have enacted any thing in their favour. And yet <hi>p.</hi> 55. the Objector ſays, <hi>Constantine</hi> did allow an Univerſal Toleration, and to that purpoſe, he quoteth <hi>Euſebitus</hi> in the 2d. Book of the Life of <hi>Constrantine, c.</hi> 55. where the Reader may eaſily obſerve, that the Liberty there granted, was to the Heathen, whom he diſtinguiſheth from the faithful, and (ſays he) let them <hi>(if they will)</hi> erect Groves and Altars to Vanity: for indeed they would do it, whether the Emperor would or no, All the Senators, and the far greateſt part of his Dominions, being Heathen; and <hi>Constantine</hi> could not deny them their Ancient Rites, <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Senatui morem gereret)</hi> leſt he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Senate.

                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpake largely of this, to no other end, but to confute thoſe, who had given out, that he had aboliſhed the Heatheniſh Rites and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes. And indeed he did not ſeek to bring the Heathen to Chriſtianity by force; but that he did by force endeavour to keep Chriſtians in Unity, is beyond all doubt. And thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Edicts which ſeem to grant Liberty to the Heathen, were framed purpoſely in favour of the Chriſtians, as that made by <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Euſebius, l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 5. For <hi>Licinius</hi> being a Heathen, violently Perſecuted the Chriſtians under his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to prevent which, this Edict ſeems to grant a General Toleration, but it eſpecially reſpected the welfare of Chriſtians, (for the Heathen (as I have ſaid) were not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed) — as, <hi>That Liberty be not denied to any, to imbrace and imitate the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without moleſtation—</hi> And, <hi>Nominatim Chriſtianis decernimus,</hi> that ſuch Places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chriſtians were wont to meet, however alienated, ſhould be reſtored to them, whether they had been ſeized by the Emperors, or by them given, or ſold to any other.

               <p>The Foundation of this Schiſme was laid on the ruine of the reputation of <hi>Cecilian,</hi> and the Catholicks in Communion with him, whom they reported to be Traditors and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, that they had nor Miniſters, nor Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their whole Worſhip was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101058:76"/>by Superſtition, and ſtrange Images, which were ſet upon their Altars. As for St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> he was a contentious Diſputer, and a perverter of Souls, rather to be avoided than refuted, or to be dealt with as a Wolf, or a Beaſt of prey, and accordingly they did lay many ſecret Snares to intrap and ruine Him.

They appealed from <hi>Meltiades,</hi> not only as partial, but as being himſelf a Traditor. Nor was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror free from their Calumny, for they report him to have been miſguided by <hi>Hoſius</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Biſhop, and other evil Counſellors: <hi>Imperatorias aures pravis ſuggeſtionibus ſuffla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas;</hi> whereof he was never more guilty, than in yielding ſo far as he did, to their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he did to a good end: <hi>Eorum perverſitatibus cedens, &amp; omnimodo cupiens tantam impudentiam cohibere;</hi> being wearied by them, and hoping by ſo many ſentences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, he might for ever ſilence their impudent clamors.

The Second <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil calls theſe Images of the Emperor's, <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata &amp; Iconas,</hi> which being ſent to great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the People went out to meet them, with Acclamations to the Emperor, whom they did honour, and not the painted Image.

And <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperor was ſaid to be ſeduced by Evil Counſellors, though he acted by the known Laws of his Anceſtors. And as to falſe accuſations, they gave ſuch proof of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in contriving them, that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at the Conference at <hi>Carthage,</hi> hearing them, contrary to evident truth, to charge <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Menſurius</hi> for <hi>Traditors,</hi> and to alledge that <hi>Optatus</hi> had written, that <hi>Cecilian</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Miltiades,</hi> and that <hi>Constantine</hi> had impriſoned him at <hi>Brixia,</hi> tells <hi>Creſconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that he wondred how the <hi>Donatists</hi> could have any Bloud in their Bodies, and not bluſh at the mentioning of ſuch things. And as to St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s particular, they gave him no other Character, but of a contentious Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that was rather to be avoided than confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and to be dealt with as a Wolf; upon no other provocation, but becauſe, as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaid, they had rather cover a bad cauſe with wicked ſlanders and excuſes, than to end it by fair diſputations and inquiry after truth. And this is the reaſon, ſaith he, that <hi>Creſconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us (Me fecit cauſam cum defeciſſet in Cauſa,)</hi> fell ſo foully on my Perſon, when I had fairly overthrown his cauſe.

And though by the wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions of God, (which becauſe they failed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101058:82"/>not, therefore we were not conſumed) our foundations were not only new layed, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtructures, to the envy and admiration of our enemies were raiſed on them; yet we ſtill feel ſuch unnatural heats, (though God be thanked we do not yet ſee the flame) that we have no Reaſon to be ſecure, or to think our building and eſtabliſhment to be ſafe, though the foundations be ſure; eſpecially if we ſhall conſider, how like this fire hath been to that of Hell, it having been for ſo many Hundred Years unquenchable.</p>
               <p>How much the Holy Waters of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which have been abundantly ſprinkled on us, have contributed to the increaſing of our flames, (notwithſtanding the boaſt of their extinguiſhing Vertue) is more to be deplored than diſputed. If any thing may be available, our penitent Tears, and importunate Prayers to the God of Peace, That he would give Peace in theſe our days, may be moſt effectual. And of this bleſſing we need not doubt, if every one would ſincerely endeavour to withdraw that fuel of ſpiritual Pride and Vain-glory, of Envy and Malice, of Carnal Luſts and Secular Intereſts, and let the Word of God, the Water of Life, dwell richly in him; for thoſe living Plants of the knowledge and fear of God, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Governors, love and good will to our Brethren, of humility and a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our ſelves, would reſiſt and ſuppreſs thoſe flames, whereas our formality and empty profeſſion, a zeal without knowledge, a ſpirit
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101058:83"/>of pride, contention and contradiction, and ambitious aſpiring, as the bramble in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of <hi>Jotham,</hi> makes us like ſo many dry ſticks and ſapleſs Leaves ready to take fire at every blaſt and motion of the Winds. Let us therefore ſtudy to be quiet, and to do our own buſineſs, to repent of our own ſins, and amend every one his own life, inſtead of Reforming Churches and Kingdomes. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Fear God and the King, and not meddle with them that are given to change.</hi>

            <p>I Have thought fit to Tranſcribe ſome few of thoſe Laws, made by the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperors, againſt this rude Faction, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution whereof (when all other means had been uſed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vain) gave a check to its growth. <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as his Nature, and his Religion more eſpecially inclined him, had long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reduce them by lenity and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but the inſolence of the Faction neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated him to a greater rigour, for he well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that his Indulgence to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> was not only an occaſion of their Cruelty to the Catholicks, but of great diſturbance in his Empire. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo, who had been an Advocate for them, againſt the rigour of the Emperial Laws, ſaw it to be expedient to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe Laws againſt them in all their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101058:83"/>except only in the caſe or Life. And whoever ſhall impartially conſider the Hiſtory of thoſe Times, may obſerve with me theſe two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as the Emperors, and their Councils, became more zealous for the Chriſtian Religion, they made ſtricter Laws, and with greater ſeverity cauſed them to be put in Execution.— <hi>2ly,</hi> That by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent execution of ſuch Laws, the inſolency of the Faction was much reſtrained, and unity and peace in a good meaſure eſtabliſhed in the Church. And indeed the life of the Laws, as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> obſerves, is in the execution of them, without which they are always a dead (and ſometime a killing) Letter, and it were much more convenient not to have them made, than being made, not to have them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; for, by this neglect, the Offenders are animated, and Authority contemned: As in the Natural body, when phyſick hath not its due operation, but only ſtirreth the humors without purging them, it cauſeth a new fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of bloud, and makes way for the noxious humors to ſeize on the vital parts: Or like the placing of an impotent Dam, to a growing River, which cauſeth the Waters to ſwell and roar, and with a greater impetus, than they could have otherwiſe exerted, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow all bounds. What <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved of the Laws of God, is as true of the Laws of Men: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed speedily; therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101058:84"/>to do evil.</hi> Common experience teacheth us, that if we only threaten our Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and chaſtiſe them not as they deſerve, they grow the more preſumptuous and ſelf-willed. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth the rod hateth his Son, but he that loveth him, chaſtneth him betimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, what prejudice and jealouſies doth ſuch a neglect beget between a Prince and his People? The Prince ſees a neceſſity of curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſolency of his People, by making wholeſome Laws; The People fancy that the Prince hath an inclination to Tyranny, but, not executing thoſe Laws, they ſuppoſe him to want power, and to be like a fooliſh Builder, who having begun to build, is not able to finiſh. And when they perceive a defect in power, as well as in prudence, to manage the Reins of Government, they endeavour to get the Bit, that was put into their Mouths, between their Teeth, and run away with their Rider. In a word, there is no Fruit more deſirable to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, than that which is forbidden, the very prohibition doth endear it, and irritate our deſires to an enjoyment. How many have publickly declared, that they could, and would have conformed to our Liturgy and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, had they not been impoſed by a Law: as if thoſe things which are in their own nature, lawful and good, became evil and unlawful, when inforced by a Law. This was long ſince practiſed by ſome Nonconformiſts, in the days of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> who commending to his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101058:84"/>Clergy the wearing of ſhort Hair, they that had been zealous for it before that time, did afterwards ſuffer their Hair to grow to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive length. This is ſuch a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, as will not be charmed with. Reaſon and Arguments, though the Charmer be never ſo wiſe; Nor will good Laws ſilence or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, without a ſeaſonable and vigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of them, which was the courſe taken by the firſt Chriſtian Emperors; as appears by the following Inſtances.</p>
